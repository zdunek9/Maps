##Features
Determining the route from point A to B with the accuracy of the house number.
Generation of a route map.
Calculation of route length, travel time and expected cost according to the formula:
-cost per kilometer * given price of driving 1 kilometer,
-assumption that you can drive max 800km per day and for each day there is a cost of 1000zl.
-fixed multiplier 110% of the sum
Saving the history of route calculation
Possibility to download the route with calculations to pdf

##The application uses:
hereAPI to determine coordinates
googleMapAPI for showing the route on the map and the maps themselves.
styled-components for styling the application ( it may not look the best, but I will deal with that in the future)
The react library was used for this project
